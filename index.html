 <p> In early November, the New York City Police Department kicked off its annual road safety initiative as the city prepared for the end of daylight savings time. As the clocks roll back and the city skies start to get darker sooner, it's proved to be a danger for pedestrians, cyclists and motorists.
 </p>

 <p> The sixth annual "Dusk and Darkness" campaign includes preventative policing measures, road education and enforcement. </p> 

 <p> 
In a press conference, NYPD Chief of Transportation Officer Kim Royster said the department is, "Focusing on hazardous violations that put our pedestrians, cyclists, seniors and children at risk. Police officers will focus on drivers that fail to yield, text and use their cell phones."</p> 


 <p> Alex Santiago, driver for Merengue Limo & Car Service in Queens, said, "the darkness is horrible" and that he feels aggravated when the sun goes down at 4 PM. Although Santiago hasn't experienced any vehicle collisions in the past few years, he said he's had a couple of close calls. "It's hard to see people sometimes when it's dark and still so early in the day," said Santiago.  </p>


 <p>Department of Transportation Assistant Commissioner Kim Wiley-Schwartz was another speaker at the press conference. She said, "Unfortunately during the pandemic we've seen an epidemic of speeding. Now, even with more cars on the road, we're seeing high speeds and some terrible crashes."

 <p>The following data from NYC Open Data, shows vehicle crashes after 4 PM during the first month of daylight savings time in March and the first month after it ends in November. The first chart is from 2019 and the second is from 2020.


</p> 



 <p>This dataset shows the total number of vehicle crashes in 2019 from March to April were higher than the amounts in November to December by 332. However, the number of crashes after daylight savings ended were much higher in 2020. There were 870 more crashes from Nov. 1, 2020 to Dec. 1, 2020 than there were in March 8, 2020 to April 8, 2020. The findings also show an increase in vehicle collisions from 2019 and 2020 for those specific months. 2020 had a total of 4,408 more crashes for those specific months than 2019. 

   <p>The early evenings not only include drivers on the road on their way home, but school children, joggers and cyclists. The NYPD, along with the DOT, will be educating the public about these dangers during the winter months and plan on setting up vehicle safety checkpoints across the city. 

</p> 

 <p>
"It's a good initiative that the NYPD is trying to do, but I just hope that it works for the sake of everyone's safety," said Santiago. </p>
